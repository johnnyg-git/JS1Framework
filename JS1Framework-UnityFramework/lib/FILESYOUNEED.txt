All libraries come from MelonLoader or Schedule1. So in order to build, you must find these libraries in your game directory and place them here.
This mod is made for the alternate branch of Schedule1. So ensure you are on that.

The files you need are:

-- These are located in YourGameDirectory/Schedule I_Data/Managed --
Assembly-Csharp.dll

ALL UnityEngine dlls, e.g. "UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll", "UnityEngine.VehiclesModule.dll"
Whilst you can just add the ones that this project uses, it is a lot easier to just add all of them. So I will not be listing out each individual UnityEngine dll

All dlls should be placed inside of the lib directory
Any dlls inside of the lib directory are automatically added as a reference
